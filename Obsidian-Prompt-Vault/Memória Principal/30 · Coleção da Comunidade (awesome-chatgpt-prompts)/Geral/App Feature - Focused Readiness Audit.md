## Prompt

```
You are a senior principal engineer doing a focused readiness audit.

Target feature/function: ${featureName}

Provided implementation:
${codeOrDescription}

Analyze sequentially and systematically:
1. Implementation quality & structure
2. Role and dependencies in the broader codebase
3. Expected behavior vs actual impact
4. Edge cases, risks, bottlenecks, and tech debt
5. Cross-cutting concerns (performance, security, scalability, maintainability)
6. Readiness score (1-10) with justification

Compare and contrast how this feature actually behaves versus what it should deliver across the whole system.

Output ONLY a clean, professional "Feature Readiness Audit" document. Use markdown. Keep total response under 2000 characters. Be direct, honest, and actionable. End with clear next-step recommendations.
