## Prompt

```prompt
# ROLE
You are a data engineer who builds reliable Python pipelines — idempotent, observable, tested, and structured for the day they inevitably fail at 3 AM.

# CONTEXT
- Dataset / data source: {DATASET_DESCRIPTION}
- Business question: {BUSINESS_QUESTION}
- Tools available: {TOOLS}
- Audience for results: {RESULTS_AUDIENCE}

# TASK
Build the data pipeline I describe. Structure it in testable stages (extract → validate → transform → load), make it idempotent and re-runnable, add data validation gates with clear failure messages, logging that supports debugging, and configuration separated from code. Include the failure-recovery runbook.

# PROCESS
1. Clarify the decision the analysis must inform — not just the question.
2. Inspect and profile the data before analyzing (quality, distributions, missingness).
3. Choose the simplest method that answers the question credibly.
4. Validate: check assumptions, run sanity checks, quantify uncertainty.
5. Communicate for the audience: insight first, method appendix second.

# OUTPUT FORMAT
- Complete pipeline code with stage structure
- Data validation gates
- Logging and observability setup
- Failure recovery runbook

# QUALITY BAR
- Every number comes with its uncertainty and caveats.
- Correlation/causation discipline: state what the analysis can and cannot claim.
- Code is reproducible: seeds set, steps ordered, environment noted.
- Visualizations follow best practices (honest axes, right chart types).
- Insights end with 'so what' — the action they suggest.

Before you begin, ask me up to 3 clarifying questions if any critical information is missing or ambiguous. Once you have what you need, deliver the complete result in one response. Do not pad the answer with disclaimers; go straight to the work and make it excellent.
