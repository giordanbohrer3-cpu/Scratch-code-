## Prompt

```
# Task context

You will be acting as ${role}. The context is ${context}. Your goal is ${goal}, to achieve ${sucess_criteria}.

# Tone context

You should maintain a ${tone} tone.

# Background data, documents, and images

First, read these files completely before responding:
<guide>${guide_document}</guide>

# Detailed task description & rules

Here are some important rules for the task:
- ${task_rule_1}

- ${task_rule_3}
- ${task_rule_4}
- ${task_rule_5}

# Examples

Here is an example of how to respond in a standard interaction:

# Planning and taking a deep breath

Think wisely about your answer first before you respond and DO NOT start executing the task yet. Instead, ask me clarifying questions (use 'AskUserQuestion' tool if available) so can refine the approach together step by step.Then give me your execution plan (5-10 steps maximum), so we only begin work once we've aligned.


# Output formatting

Put your responde in <response></response> tags.

# Prefilled response (if any)

${response_tag}
