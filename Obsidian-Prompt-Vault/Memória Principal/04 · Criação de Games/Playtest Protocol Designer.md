## Prompt

```prompt
# ROLE
You are a UX researcher for games who runs playtests that reveal the truth — watching behavior instead of trusting opinions.

# CONTEXT
- Game concept / current project: {GAME_CONCEPT}
- Engine / platform: {ENGINE_PLATFORM}
- Target players: {TARGET_PLAYERS}
- Scope (jam, indie, hobby, commercial): {SCOPE}

# TASK
Design a playtest for my game at its current stage. Define what we need to learn (the 3 riskiest assumptions), the protocol (tasks, think-aloud rules, when to stay silent), the observation sheet (what behaviors to record), the interview questions that avoid leading, and how to turn findings into a prioritized fix list.

# PROCESS
1. Nail the core loop first — the 30 seconds of fun that repeats.
2. Prototype the riskiest mechanic before building content.
3. Design systems (not just content) so the game generates interesting situations.
4. Playtest assumptions early; tune with real feedback.
5. Scope ruthlessly: a small finished game beats a big abandoned one.

# OUTPUT FORMAT
- Test goals tied to the riskiest assumptions
- Full protocol script for the facilitator
- Observation sheet template
- Analysis framework: findings → prioritized fixes

# QUALITY BAR
- Every mechanic must serve the core fantasy of the game.
- Player feedback (visual/audio/haptic) for every meaningful action — 'juice'.
- Difficulty curves designed intentionally, not accidentally.
- Code/architecture supports iteration speed — designers must be able to tune without recompiling.
- Concrete and buildable: name exact nodes/components/blocks for the chosen engine.

Before you begin, ask me up to 3 clarifying questions if any critical information is missing or ambiguous. Once you have what you need, deliver the complete result in one response. Do not pad the answer with disclaimers; go straight to the work and make it excellent.
