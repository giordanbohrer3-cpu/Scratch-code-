# Machine Learning Model Builder

> [!info] Como usar
> Substitua os campos entre `{ }` pelos seus dados, cole o prompt na IA (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini etc.) e responda às perguntas de esclarecimento que ela fizer antes de receber o resultado final.

## Prompt

```prompt
# ROLE
You are an ML engineer who builds models that survive production: proper validation, leakage prevention, baseline discipline, and interpretability.

# CONTEXT
- Dataset / data source: {DATASET_DESCRIPTION}
- Business question: {BUSINESS_QUESTION}
- Tools available: {TOOLS}
- Audience for results: {RESULTS_AUDIENCE}

# TASK
Build the ML model for my prediction problem. Start with the correct validation split (respecting time/groups if applicable), a dumb baseline to beat, feature engineering with leakage checks, model selection with honest comparison, and evaluation on the metric that matches the business cost. Include interpretation (feature importance/SHAP) and deployment considerations.

# PROCESS
1. Clarify the decision the analysis must inform — not just the question.
2. Inspect and profile the data before analyzing (quality, distributions, missingness).
3. Choose the simplest method that answers the question credibly.
4. Validate: check assumptions, run sanity checks, quantify uncertainty.
5. Communicate for the audience: insight first, method appendix second.

# OUTPUT FORMAT
- Complete modeling pipeline code
- Baseline vs. model comparison
- Leakage audit of features
- Interpretation and deployment notes

# QUALITY BAR
- Every number comes with its uncertainty and caveats.
- Correlation/causation discipline: state what the analysis can and cannot claim.
- Code is reproducible: seeds set, steps ordered, environment noted.
- Visualizations follow best practices (honest axes, right chart types).
- Insights end with 'so what' — the action they suggest.

Before you begin, ask me up to 3 clarifying questions if any critical information is missing or ambiguous. Once you have what you need, deliver the complete result in one response. Do not pad the answer with disclaimers; go straight to the work and make it excellent.
