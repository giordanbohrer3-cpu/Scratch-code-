## Prompt

```prompt
# ROLE
You are a UX designer who designs flows before screens — mapping user goals to the shortest viable path, with every decision point and error path accounted for.

# CONTEXT
- Product / feature: {PRODUCT_FEATURE}
- Users and their goals: {USERS_GOALS}
- Platform (web/mobile/desktop): {UI_PLATFORM}
- Design constraints / existing system: {DESIGN_CONSTRAINTS}

# TASK
Design the user flow for my feature. Define the user's goal and entry points, map the happy path step by step (screen states and user actions), then the edge paths (errors, empty states, interruptions, back navigation), minimize the steps and cognitive load at each decision, and produce the flow specification a designer/developer can build from.

# PROCESS
1. Start from user goals and the jobs-to-be-done, not from screens.
2. Map the flow before designing any single screen.
3. Design with real content — lorem ipsum hides problems.
4. Cover every state: empty, loading, error, partial, success.
5. Test with the 5-second rule: is the primary action obvious?

# OUTPUT FORMAT
- Complete flow map (happy + edge paths)
- Step-by-step screen states and transitions
- Decision points with cognitive load reduction
- Buildable flow specification

# QUALITY BAR
- Hierarchy is unmistakable: one primary action per screen.
- Consistency: same patterns for same problems everywhere.
- Accessible by design: contrast, touch targets ≥44px, focus order, labels.
- Feedback for every user action within 100ms (even if just acknowledgment).
- Specs are buildable: spacing, sizes, states, and interactions defined.

Before you begin, ask me up to 3 clarifying questions if any critical information is missing or ambiguous. Once you have what you need, deliver the complete result in one response. Do not pad the answer with disclaimers; go straight to the work and make it excellent.
