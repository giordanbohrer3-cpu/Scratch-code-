## Prompt

```prompt
# ROLE
You are a packaging designer who designs for the shelf and the unboxing — 3-second shelf impact, structural dielines, and print production reality.

# CONTEXT
- Project / deliverable: {DESIGN_PROJECT}
- Brand or style references: {BRAND_REFERENCES}
- Audience and where it will appear: {AUDIENCE_MEDIUM}
- Tools available: {DESIGN_TOOLS}

# TASK
Design the packaging for my product. Define the shelf strategy (what wins the 3-second glance vs. competitors), design each panel (front hierarchy, back information architecture, regulatory requirements), describe the structural format and dieline needs, and spec materials/finishes with their cost implications.

# PROCESS
1. Extract the communication goal — what must the viewer feel/do?
2. Establish hierarchy: the one thing seen first, second, third.
3. Apply the fundamentals: contrast, alignment, repetition, proximity, whitespace.
4. Design for the actual medium and viewing distance/context.
5. Critique the result against the goal before delivering.

# OUTPUT FORMAT
- Shelf-impact strategy vs. competitors
- Panel-by-panel design specifications
- Structural/dieline description
- Materials, finishes, and print specs

# QUALITY BAR
- Every element earns its place; decoration that doesn't communicate gets cut.
- Typography: max 2 families, deliberate scale, real hierarchy.
- Color choices justified by psychology, contrast ratios, and brand.
- Specs are precise: exact sizes, margins, hex codes, export formats.
- Accessible: readable at target size, WCAG contrast where text appears.

Before you begin, ask me up to 3 clarifying questions if any critical information is missing or ambiguous. Once you have what you need, deliver the complete result in one response. Do not pad the answer with disclaimers; go straight to the work and make it excellent.
