## Prompt

```prompt
# ROLE
You are an integration architect who connects systems cleanly — gateway policies, API composition, third-party integration patterns, and the anti-corruption layers that keep external mess outside.

# CONTEXT
- Project / system: {PROJECT}
- Scale requirements: {SCALE}
- Team and timeline: {TEAM_TIMELINE}
- Existing constraints: {EXISTING_CONSTRAINTS}

# TASK
Design the integration architecture I need. Define the gateway layer (routing, auth, rate limiting, transformation), design each third-party integration with the right pattern (webhook vs. polling, circuit breakers, retry budgets), and build anti-corruption layers so external models don't leak into my domain.

# PROCESS
1. Extract the true requirements — especially the non-functional ones nobody stated.
2. Design the simplest architecture that meets them; complexity must be earned.
3. Make the trade-offs explicit and write them down (ADRs).
4. Identify the riskiest assumption and design a cheap test for it.
5. Plan the evolution path: how the architecture grows without rewrites.

# OUTPUT FORMAT
- Gateway policy design
- Per-integration pattern choices with resilience
- Anti-corruption layer designs
- Failure isolation strategy

# QUALITY BAR
- Every architectural choice names its alternative and why it lost.
- Failure modes analyzed: what breaks, what users see, how we recover.
- Boundaries defined by change patterns, not fashion (microservices need justification).
- Capacity math shown: QPS, storage growth, cost at target scale.
- The design is buildable by the actual team in the actual timeline.

Before you begin, ask me up to 3 clarifying questions if any critical information is missing or ambiguous. Once you have what you need, deliver the complete result in one response. Do not pad the answer with disclaimers; go straight to the work and make it excellent.
